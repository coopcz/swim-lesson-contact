## What You Need to Do to Get It Running

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Database

**You already have a Supabase account, now you need to set up the database:**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` 
5. Paste it into the SQL editor and click **Run**
6. Do the same for `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql`

This will create all the necessary tables for the system.

### Step 2: Create Your First Admin User

1. In Supabase, go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Click **Add user** ‚Üí **Create new user**
3. Enter Sarah's email and create a password
4. Save the email and password somewhere safe - Sarah will need this to log in

5. Now go back to **SQL Editor** and run this command (replace the email with Sarah's actual email):

```sql
-- First, get Sarah's user ID
SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'sarah@lifequest.com';

-- Create the LifeQuest organization
INSERT INTO orgs (name) VALUES ('LifeQuest') RETURNING id;

-- Add Sarah as an admin (replace USER_ID and ORG_ID with the values from above)
INSERT INTO org_members (org_id, user_id, role) 
VALUES ('ORG_ID_HERE', 'USER_ID_HERE', 'admin');
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Get this from your Supabase project settings
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Get this from your Supabase project settings
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Get this from your Supabase project settings (under Service Role)

### Step 4: Sign Up for Twilio (SMS Service)

**What Twilio does:** Sends text messages to parents' phones.

1. Go to [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** and create an account
3. Verify your phone number and email
4. **Add a payment method** (required, but they give you free trial credit)
5. **Buy a phone number:**
   - Go to **Phone Numbers** ‚Üí **Buy a number**
   - Choose a number with SMS capability
   - Complete the purchase
6. **Get your credentials:**
   - Go to your Twilio Console dashboard
   - Copy your **Account SID** and **Auth Token**
   - Copy your **Phone Number** (the one you just bought)
7. Add these to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid_here
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
   ```

### Step 5: Sign Up for Resend (Email Service)

**What Resend does:** Sends emails to parents.

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** and create an account
3. **Verify your domain** (this is important!):
   - Go to **Domains** ‚Üí **Add Domain**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., lifequest.com)
   - Resend will give you DNS records to add
   - You'll need to add these DNS records through your domain provider
   - Wait for verification (can take up to 24 hours)
4. **Get your API key:**
   - Go to **API Keys**
   - Click **Create API Key**
   - Copy the key (you can only see it once!)
5. Add this to your `.env.local` file:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 6: Test Locally

1. Open Terminal (on Mac, search for "Terminal" in Spotlight)
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/coopcz/swim-lesson-contact
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:3000
5. Log in with Sarah's email and password
6. Try uploading a test CSV file

### Step 7: Deploy to Vercel (Make It Live)

**What Vercel does:** Hosts your website so anyone can access it online.

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click **Sign Up** and sign up with GitHub
3. Click **Add New Project**
4. Import your GitHub repository (you'll need to push your code to GitHub first)
5. **Add environment variables in Vercel:**
   - In your project settings, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
   - Add all the variables from your `.env.local` file:
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
     - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

     - TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
     - TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN

### Step 8: Push Code to GitHub

If you haven't already:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. In Terminal, run these commands:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## How to Use the System

### For Sarah (Admin):

1. **Log in** at your Vercel URL
2. **Upload a roster:**
   - Export a CSV from Mindbody
   - Click "Upload Roster"
   - Map the columns (the system will auto-detect them)
   - Click "Import Roster"
3. **Send a message:**
   - Click "Compose"
   - Select a lesson group (e.g., "Jellyfish")
   - Choose Email, SMS, or Both
   - Write your message
   - Use variables like {{parent_name}} and {{child_name}}
   - Click "Preview" to see how it looks
   - Click "Send"
4. **Monitor delivery:**
   - Click "Batches" to see all sent messages
   - Click on a batch to see detailed delivery status
5. **Emergency alerts:**
   - Click the red "üö® Emergency Alert" button in the nav bar
   - This bypasses quiet hours

### For Lindsey (Staff):

Lindsey will have the same access as Sarah. To add Lindsey:

1. In Supabase, go to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Users**
2. Create a new user for Lindsey
3. Get Lindsey's user ID from the auth.users table
4. Run this SQL command:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO org_members (org_id, user_id, role) 
   VALUES ('YOUR_ORG_ID', 'LINDSEY_USER_ID', 'admin');
   ```

## Important Notes

### SMS Opt-Out Compliance

- Every SMS automatically includes "Reply STOP to opt out"
- When someone replies STOP, they're automatically opted out
- You need to set up the Twilio webhook for this (see Advanced Setup below)

### Quiet Hours

- By default, SMS won't send between 9 PM and 7 AM
- Emergency mode bypasses this restriction
- You can change these times in the code (lib/utils.ts)

### Costs

- **Twilio:** ~$0.0079 per SMS sent (so 100 texts = $0.79)
- **Resend:** 3,000 emails/month free, then $20/month
- **Vercel:** Free for this size project
- **Supabase:** Free for this size project

### CSV Format

Your Mindbody export should include these columns:
- Parent Name
- Child Name
- Email
- Phone
- Lesson Name
- Lesson Time (optional)
- Weekday (optional)

The column mapper will auto-detect them, but you can manually map if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to Supabase"
- Check that your environment variables are correct
- Make sure you ran the database migrations

### "SMS not sending"
- Check that your Twilio credentials are correct
- Make sure you have credit in your Twilio account
- Verify the phone number is valid and in E.164 format (+1234567890)

### "Email not sending"
- Check that your Resend API key is correct
- Make sure your domain is verified in Resend
- Check the Resend dashboard for error logs

### "Can't log in"
- Make sure the user exists in Supabase Authentication
- Make sure the user is added to the org_members table
- Check that the password is correct

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Message templates library
- [ ] Scheduled messages (send later)
- [ ] Message history and analytics
- [ ] Multiple organizations support
