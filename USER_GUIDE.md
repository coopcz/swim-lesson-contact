   - Click **Browse Files** and select the file

The first time you upload, you'll need to tell the system which column is which:

- **Parent Name** ‚Üí Select the column with parent/guardian names

### Step 2: Write Your Message

**For Email:**
- Enter a **Subject Line** (e.g., "Pool Closure Tomorrow")

```
Hi {{parent_name}},

This is a reminder that {{child_name}}'s swim lesson in {{lesson_name}} 
is tomorrow at {{lesson_time}}.

See you at the pool!
- LifeQuest Swim Team
```

Will become:
```
Hi Sarah Cooper,

This is a reminder that Emma Cooper's swim lesson in Jellyfish 
is tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid phone number" errors

**Problem:** Some text messages failed with "invalid phone number"

**Solution:** 
- Phone numbers must include area code
- Must be 10 digits for US numbers
- Format doesn't matter (555-1234, (555) 123-4567, 5551234567 all work)
- Update the phone in Mindbody and re-upload the roster

### "Invalid email address" errors

**Problem:** Some emails bounced or failed

**Solution:**
- Check for typos in the email address (missing @, .com vs .con)
- Make sure the email address is complete
- Update in Mindbody and re-upload

### Messages are stuck in "Pending"

**Problem:** Messages show as pending for more than 5 minutes

**Solution:**
- This is usually a temporary issue
- Messages will retry automatically
- If still pending after 30 minutes, contact your system administrator

### "Quiet Hours" blocking my message

**Problem:** You need to send a message but it's blocked by quiet hours (9 PM - 7 AM)

**Solution:**
- Use the **Emergency Alert** feature if it's truly urgent (bypasses quiet hours)
- OR wait until after 7 AM to send
- Regular messages won't send during quiet hours to respect parents' time

### Can't find a lesson group

**Problem:** You uploaded a roster but don't see the lesson group

**Solution:**
- Go to **View Lessons** to see all groups
- If it's missing, check that the CSV had a lesson name in that column
- Re-upload the roster if needed

### Parents didn't receive messages

**Problem:** Messages show as "Sent" but parents say they didn't get them

**Solution:**

**For Text Messages:**
- Ask if they've blocked the number
- Check if they previously replied STOP (they'll be opted out)
- Verify their phone number is correct

**For Emails:**
- Ask them to check spam/junk folder
- Have them add your email to contacts
- Verify their email address is correct

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do's

- **Test first:** Send a test message to yourself before sending to everyone
- **Keep it short:** Shorter messages are more likely to be read
- **Use variables:** Personalize with parent and child names
- **Preview:** Always preview before sending
- **Update regularly:** Upload your roster weekly to keep contact info current

### ‚ùå Don'ts

- **Don't send too often:** Parents appreciate important updates, not spam
- **Don't use ALL CAPS:** Looks like shouting
- **Don't skip preview:** Typos happen!
- **Don't send during quiet hours:** Unless it's a true emergency
- **Don't forget opt-outs:** If someone opts out, respect their choice
