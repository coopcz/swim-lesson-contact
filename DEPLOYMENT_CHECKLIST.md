# üöÄ Deployment Checklist - LifeQuest Swim Comms

Follow this checklist to deploy your app to production. Check off each item as you complete it.

---

## Before Deployment

### ‚úÖ Code Changes

- [x] Twilio and Resend packages installed
- [x] Dispatcher API route created (`app/api/cron/dispatcher/route.ts`)
- [x] Twilio webhook created (`app/api/webhooks/twilio-stop/route.ts`)
- [x] `vercel.json` cron configuration created
- [x] Test CSV file created (`test-roster.csv`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Update Email Address

**YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE DEPLOYING!**

1. Open `/app/api/cron/dispatcher/route.ts`
2. Find line ~75 (in the Resend email section)
3. Change this line:
   ```typescript
   from: 'LifeQuest Swim Team <notifications@yourdomain.com>',
   ```
   to:
   ```typescript
   from: 'LifeQuest Swim Team <notifications@YOUR-VERIFIED-DOMAIN.com>',
   ```
4. Replace `YOUR-VERIFIED-DOMAIN.com` with the domain you verified in Resend
5. Save the file
6. Commit the change:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update sender email address"
   git push
   ```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit and Push Your Code

```bash
cd /Users/coopcz/swim-lesson-contact
git add .
git commit -m "Add message dispatcher and complete production setup"
git push origin main
```

**What this does:** Pushes all new code to GitHub, which Vercel will automatically detect and deploy.

---

### Step 2: Verify Vercel Deployment

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Log in to your account
3. Find your project: `swim-lesson-contact`
4. You should see a new deployment in progress
5. Wait for it to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
6. Look for "‚úì Deployment Ready"

---

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure ALL of these are set in Vercel:

1. In Vercel, go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Check that you have:

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anon/public key
- [ ] `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key (secret!)
- [ ] `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - From Twilio console
- [ ] `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - From Twilio console
- [ ] `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your Twilio number (format: +1XXXXXXXXXX)
- [ ] `RESEND_API_KEY` - From Resend dashboard

**If any are missing:**
1. Click "Add New"
2. Enter the Name and Value
3. Click "Save"
4. Redeploy your app (Vercel ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy)

---

### Step 4: Verify Cron Job Is Active

1. In Vercel, go to your project ‚Üí Cron Jobs tab
2. You should see: `/api/cron/dispatcher` scheduled to run every minute (`* * * * *`)
3. Status should be "Active"

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** Cron jobs require a Vercel Pro plan ($20/month). If you're on the free Hobby plan, you'll need to upgrade OR implement an alternative (contact support for options).

---

### Step 5: Configure Twilio Webhook (For SMS Opt-Outs)

1. Log into [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com)
2. Go to Phone Numbers ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Active Numbers
3. Click on your SMS-enabled phone number
4. Scroll to "Messaging Configuration"
5. Under "A MESSAGE COMES IN":
   - Webhook: `https://YOUR-VERCEL-URL.vercel.app/api/webhooks/twilio-stop`
   - HTTP Method: `POST`
6. Click Save

**Replace `YOUR-VERCEL-URL` with your actual Vercel URL!**

---

## Testing Phase

Now it's time to test everything! Follow the comprehensive `TESTING_GUIDE.md` step by step.

### Critical Tests (Must Pass):

- [ ] **Test 1:** Login works
- [ ] **Test 2:** CSV upload works
- [ ] **Test 4:** SMS sends and arrives on your phone
- [ ] **Test 5:** Email sends and arrives in your inbox
- [ ] **Test 6:** Batch monitoring shows accurate status
- [ ] **Test 11:** SMS opt-out (reply STOP) works

**Start here:** Open `TESTING_GUIDE.md` and follow every test in order.

---

## Post-Testing Tasks

Once all tests pass:

### Update Test CSV with Your Info

Before Test 4 (SMS test), you'll need to:

1. Open `test-roster.csv`
2. Change the first row to YOUR phone number and email:
   ```
   Your Name,Child Name,your-email@example.com,+15551234567,Jellyfish,Monday,9:00 AM
   ```
3. Save the file
4. Upload this modified CSV through the app

### Clean Up (Optional)

- [ ] Delete test message batches from database (optional - they don't hurt anything)
- [ ] Remove test contacts if desired
